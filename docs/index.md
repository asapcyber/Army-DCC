# Welcome to the US Army Direct Commission Course
Congratulations on your selection to attend the DCC at Fort Moore, Georgia. Our
mission is to develop and train officers on the fundamental skills, leadership, physical
fitness, mental toughness, tactical and technical proficiency, who are ready to join our Army
at war while taking care of our Soldiers, Civilians, and Army Families. This is a 6-week
course where you will be challenged physically, mentally, and emotionally.

## Welcome Packet

- DCC Packing list

## Leadership

In order to provide the best level of instruction and impart the US Army Doctrine to DCC students in 6 weeks, we rely on 
a set of strong leaders from all ranks in the Infantry School.
